## Setup and usage
This repository was built in such a manner that allows users to easily reproduce
the entire analysis pipeline. In particular, the code automatically handles
the folders structures and files by using relative paths. It is mandatory to 
follow the instructions reported at the beginning of each file in the "code"
folder in order to correctly execute all the analysis.
